      "story": """The Right To Be Rich  
      WHATEVER may be said in praise of poverty, the fact remains that it is not possible to live a really complete or successful life unless one is rich. No man can rise to his greatest possible height in talent or soul development unless he has plenty of money; for to unfold the soul and to develop talent he must have many things to use, and he cannot have these things unless he has money to buy them with.
      A man develops in mind, soul, and body by making use of things, and society is so organized that man must have money in order to become the possessor of things; therefore, the basis of all advancement for man must be the science of getting rich. 
      The object of all life is development; and everything that lives has an inalienable right to all the development it is capable of attaining.
      Man's right to life means his right to have the free and unrestricted use of all the things which may be necessary to his fullest mental, spiritual, and physical unfoldment; or, in other words, his right to be rich. 
      this book, I shall not speak of riches in a figurative way; to be really rich does not mean to be satisfied or contented with a little. No man ought to be satisfied with a little if he is capable of using and enjoying more. The purpose of Nature is the advancement and unfoldment of life; and every man should have all that can contribute to the power, elegance, beauty, and richness of life; to be content with less is sinful. 
      The man who owns all he wants for the living of all the life he is capable of living is rich; and no man who has not plenty of money can have all he wants. Life has advanced so far, and become so complex, that even the most ordinary man or woman requires a great amount of wealth in order to live in a manner that even approaches completeness. 
      Ever y person naturally wants to become all that they are capable of becoming; this desire to realize innate possibilities is inherent in human nature; we cannot help wanting to be all that we can be. Success in life is becoming what you want to be; you can become what you want to be only by making use of things, and you can have the free use of things only as you become rich enough to buy them. To understand the science of getting rich is therefore the most essential of all knowledge. 
      There is nothing wrong in wanting to get rich. The desire for riches is really the desire for a richer, fuller, and more abundant life; and that desire is praise worthy. The man who does not desire to live more abundantly is abnormal, and so the man who does not desire to have money enough to buy all he wants is abnormal. 
      There are three motives for which we live; we live for the body, we live for the mind, we live for the soul. No one of these is better or holier than the other; all are alike desirable, and no one of the three -- body, mind, or soul -- can live fully if either of the others is cut short of full life and expression. It is not right or noble to live only for the soul and deny mind or body; and it is wrong to live for the intellect and deny body or soul. 
      We are all acquainted with the loathsome consequences of living for the body and denying both mind and soul; and we see that real life means the complete expression of all that man can give forth through body, mind, and soul. 
      Whatever he can say, no man can be really happy or satisfied unless his body is living fully in every function, and unless the same is true of his mind and his soul. Wherever there is unexpressed possibility, or function not performed, there is unsatisfied desire. Desire is possibility seeking expression, or function seeking performance. \nMan cannot live fully in body without good food, comfortable clothing, and warm shelter; and without freedom from excessive toil. Rest and recreation are also necessary to his physical life. \nHe cannot live fully in mind without books and time to study them, without opportunity for travel and observation, or without intellectual companionship. 
      To live fully in mind he must have intellectual recreations, and must surround himself with all the objects of art and beauty he is capable of using and appreciating. \nTo live fully in soul, man must have love; and love is denied expression by poverty. 
      A man's highest happiness is found in the bestowal of benefits on those he loves; love finds its most natural and spontaneous expression in giving. The man who has nothing to give cannot fill his place as a husband or father, as a citizen, or as a man. It is in the use of material things that a man finds full life for his body, develops his mind, and unfolds his soul. It is therefore of supreme importance to him that he should be rich. 
      It is perfectly right that you should desire to be rich; if you are a normal man or woman you cannot help doing so. \nIt is perfectly right that you should give your best attention to the Science of Getting Rich, for it is the noblest and most necessary of all studies. If you neglect this study, you are derelict in your duty to yourself, to God and humanity; for you can render to God and humanity no greater service than to make the most of yourself.

      There is A Science of Getting Rich.

      THERE is a Science of getting rich, and it is an exact science, like algebra or arithmetic. There are certain laws which govern the process of acquiring riches; once these laws are learned and obeyed by any man, he will get rich with mathematical certainty. 
      The ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way; those who do things in this Certain Way, whether on purpose or accidentally, get rich; while those who do not do things in this Certain Way, no matter how hard they work or how able they are, remain poor. \nIt is a natural law that like causes always produce like effects; and, therefore, any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich.

      That the above statement is true is shown by the following facts:

      Getting rich is not a matter of environment, for, if it were, all the people in certain neighborhoods would become wealthy; the people of one city would all be rich, while those of other towns would all be poor; or the inhabitants of one state would roll in wealth, while those of an adjoining state would be in poverty. 
      But everywhere we see rich and poor living side by side, in the same environment, and often engaged in the same vocations. When two men are in the same locality, and in the same business, and one gets rich while the other remains poor, it shows that getting rich is not, primarily, a matter of environment. Some environments may be more favorable than others, but when two men in the same business are in the same neighborhood, and one gets rich while the other fails, it indicates that getting rich is the result of doing things in a Certain Way. 
      And further, the ability to do things in this certain way is not due solely to the possession of talent, for many people who have great talent remain poor, while other who have very little talent get rich. \nStudying the people who have got rich, we find that they are an average lot in all respects, having no greater talents and abilities than other men. It is evident that they do not get rich because they possess talents and abilities that other men have not, but because they happen to do things in a Certain Way.
      Getting rich is not the result of saving, or thrift; many very penurious people are poor, while free spenders often get rich. \nNor is getting rich due to doing things which others fail to do; for two men in the same business often do almost exactly the same things, and one gets rich while the other remains poor or becomes bankrupt. \nFrom all these things, we must come to the conclusion that getting rich is the result of doing things in a Certain Way. 
      If getting rich is the result of doing things in a Certain Way, and if like causes always produce like effects, then any man or woman who can do things in that way can become rich, and the whole matter is brought within the domain of exact science. \nThe question arises here, whether this Certain Way may not be so difficult that only a few may follow it.""",

      "story":
          """PAT KENNEDY OPENED HIS EYES, then slowly examined his surroundings, he recognised his room at the Villa Contessa and felt a surge of immense pleasure. A month had passed since he had decided to isolate himself, like many of the very rich, far from the crowds, the stress of meetings and the constant hustle of the City of London.
      He bounded out of bed, stretched, picked up the remote and zapped open the roller shutters of his large high ceilinged bedroom. The sun streamed in from the southwest, it was another early summer morning.
      Pat shaded his eyes and admired the magnificent view over the terrace, the Mediterranean sparkled like a silver platter beyond the villa’s luxuriant gardens.
      He felt good.
      Life was very good, far from Boris Johnson’s fatuous ‘Let’s get going’ Britain.
      What had been planned as a rest in Beaulieu-sur-mer was now becoming a habit. He had little desire to return to London, even less Hong Kong. He just wanted to lay back, admire the colours and breath in the perfumes of the French Riviera.
      But to start the day he had an appointment at Lifegen, for his first check-up and at breakfast he informed George, his butler cum household manager, he would drive to Sophia Antipolis himself and return after lunch with Rob McGoldrick.
      He’d never felt so well, relaxed, being far from the pressures of London, Paris and Hong Kong was having its effect.
      Rob McGoldrick had always reminded Pat that good health was primordial, keeping a toned muscle structure for as long as possible not only helped to preserve mobility in later life, it also improved the aesthetics of ageing, helped maintain the firmness of the face and body, keeping him looking fit and youthful.
      However, that was not all, it was also essential to feel good, build a positive view of life, which started with a diet to improve cardiovascular health, reduce cholesterol levels, lessen the risks of osteoarthritis. Starting with a plant based diet and eating less meat and animal based products.
      Pat had learnt that the skin was a great indicator of health, that a diet of fresh fruit and vegetables improved the complexion, healing and moisturising the skin, making for a younger appearance, boosting that feel-good sense of contentment.
      It was why when he looked at his reflection in his bathroom mirror, he felt pleased with what he saw, his smooth skin and the glow a healthy tan gave. On Rob’s recommendations he had spent his time relaxing by the pool and enjoying just enough sun. But there was something else. He looked more closely at his skin, it seemed firmer, clearer. He stretched his cheek with his fingers. There was no mistaking it, he definitely looked younger.
      He picked up his cellphone, glanced at the messages, checked the biometric data on his Apple Watch, a GPS+Cellular. Everything looked in order, all details were transmitted to the LifeGen site via a direct link, open 24/24, where his data was monitored in real-time.
      Looking at his cell and watch, the idea occurred to him that he and those around him were evolving into cyborgs of a kind, which didn’t worry him more than that.
      After dressing, Pat skipped down the broad marble stairway and through the open French windows onto the villa’s terrace, where he paused to eat a freshly prepared fruit salad. He then headed for the garage situated behind the gardens under the shade of a tall stand of cypresses where his driver was waiting. He wished Pat good morning and handed him the keys of the car that was already parked on the gravel driveway.
      With no more ado Pat slid in behind the wheel of the burgundy coloured 1967 Citroen DS cabriolet, his favorite, one he felt went with the style of the villa. He had always been fascinated by the Côte d’Azur and the people who had lived there—Picasso, Van Gogh, Grace Kelly, Coco Chanel and especially Scott Fitzgerald. He liked to imagine himself in the role of one of the writer’s literary heroes.
      Heading off along the winding road he breathed in the morning air before he hit La Provençale—the winding autoroute that would take him around Nice and on to Valbonne and the Sophia Antipolis Science Park.
      Forty five minutes later he was at LifeGen where his friend, Rob, was just arriving after having taken a taxi directly from Nice airport.
      ‘Hi Pat, how are you,’ said Rob smiling. ‘Like the car. The Mediterranean air must be doing you good, you’re looking in great form.’
      Pat grinned, he was feeling good.
      Michel Morel appeared at the smoked glass doors that led into the reception area of the futuristic research centre. He looked pleased to see his friends. ‘Let’s go to the conference room, Jean-Yves is waiting for us.’
      Standing before an extra large flat TV screen at one end of the conference room Jean-Yves was juggling with various images from a laptop.
      ‘Hi guys, I’m just trying to get these pictures in the right order.’
      They sat down around the oval table facing the screen exchanging small talk as a secretary oversaw the coffee served by an attractive assistant in a white coat.
      ‘So,’ commenced Michel Morel looking at Pat, ‘let’s get down to business. How’s our laboratory primate doing.’
      They all laughed.
      ‘Great, I’m feeling great.’
      ‘That’s good news, no side effects?’
      ‘Nothing visible,’ said Pat laying his hand of the table. ‘Touch wood.’
      ‘Excellent. Jean-Yves is going to run through the data comparison with that Rob supplied us, together with the blood tests and scans made in Beaulieu at the end of last week.’
      There was nothing amiss, the data confirmed what they had expected, not only was their ‘primate’ was in perfect form, he was bursting with health.
      After Pat was given a clean bill of health they skipped lunch and together with Rob he bid his friends at LifeGen goodbye.
      Dropping his bags into the boot Rob jumped into the cabriolet beside Pat who with a hoot of the horn accelerated off in the direction of Nice and the road back to Beaulieu. Rob was looking forward to his break, delighted to get away from the dismal summer weather in London, taking in the silky warmth of the Mediterranean air and easy going life of the Riviera as Pat’s guest for the weekend.
      Pat felt elated as he sped along the Corniche, radiating his pleasure with life, not only was his body in good health, but a burden had been lifted from his mind and he could turn his attention to other issues that were important to him.
      The initial tests had shown he had new vitality, naturally it would require further, deeper, scientific cell analysis, but it seemed certain that the Galenus formulation had significantly boosted his drive, his verve.
      After Rob was shown to his room Pat proposed a game of tennis, then, after a couple of sets, they passed the afternoon relaxing by the pool before driving into Nice to find a place to eat in the Old Town.
      Rob was astonished by the change that had taken place in his friend, he seemed so brash, carefree, and he actually looked younger.""",

      St. Michel Chapel
      0300 hours
 
      Brother Jean-Baptiste Chevalier would be dead in less than an hour. Had he known that would be the result, he would never have agreed to this unholy mission.
      Since he was oblivious as to how this would end, Brother Chevalier unknowingly shuffled down the aisle of the cruciform, Romanesque, St. Michel Chapel. The hour was late, and because he carried with him the manuscript he set out to retrieve two days ago, no one would care about the time of night or his tardiness.
      Were it daylight he would have admired the architectural grandeur surrounding him. The barrel-vault ceiling that curved smooth stone 22 meters high, stretching the entire length of the 97-meter long cathedral. The nave etching a path toward the ornate marble altar, sculpted with scenes of the Holy Family. Stain-glass, rose windows would have allowed beams of sunshine to dance across the face of the assembled parishioners sitting diligently in prayer as they listened to the Word of the Lord. Two aisles crossed paths with the nave while the transept formed the top portion of the cross-like cathedral. One led into the choir; the other into the sanctuary.
      Conversely, at nightfall St. Michel Chapel took on a completely different look. Ominous beams of moonlight shone like beacons in through the stain-glass windows. Tonight rain fell and thunder struck, so that the cathedral took on a more threatening connotation. A flash of lightning crackled, illuminating a sculpted stone pillar of Christ in agony causing a shiver to run down the spine of Brother Chevalier as his long, black cloak skimmed the smooth polish of the stone floor.
      The church was dark, the weather menacing, but Brother Chevalier had made this walk many times before. It was not the darkness of the cathedral that frightened him; it was what was about to happen that chilled his bones.
      He continued walking, quickening his pace, turning right at the transept until he reached the sanctuary. Once inside the Holy Room, Brother Chevalier opened an ornate side door, a bas-relief of Christ on the cross sculpted flawlessly upon it, and descended the flight of spiral stone steps on its opposite side.
      At the bottom of the steps, he turned right entering the catacombs of the hundred-year-old cathedral. The passage was narrow, not more than two meters high and three across. Made from the same stone that had been part of the original bedrock, the catacombs held one of the most sacred features of the cathedral that only those privileged enough ever saw. Every ten feet, niches, carved into the walls, held votive candles resting on wrought-iron braziers around magnificently sculpted, painstakingly decorated statutes of the Holy Family and several prominent saints frozen in silent prayer. The long stone hall finally ended abruptly fifty feet from the stone steps that led down from the cathedral. A thick oak door with iron hinges stopped any further progress.
      Normally, this door remained locked. Keeping its secrets confined to the opposite side. Tonight, however, it was not.
      Without knocking, Brother Chevalier entered the room.
      The room was not large, just big enough for its purpose. A plain, round, oak table occupied the center of the room. A modest fireplace, crackling with burning ambers, was set into the room’s far corner. The walls were plain stone. Smooth and decorated with two tapestries depicting the coat of arms of their Order- a black and white, cross Fleury, that counter-changed over a black and white shield, divided quarterly, and forming eight triangular pieces called a gyronny.
      He went directly to the head of the table to greet the Master of the Order of the Dominicans, Father Vicente Francisco. Brother Chevalier knelt on one knee, presenting his Master with the soft, leather bound, handwritten manuscript about the size of a standard sized bible.
      “Thank you, Brother Chevalier; your efforts will not go unnoticed.” Father Vicente took the manuscript from his fellow brother then motioned for him to sit beside him.
      The Master of the Order continued, “Two days ago a beloved member of our brethren died. With him, he took the knowledge that so many sought. His collections of works could fill the libraries of Rome and Florence three-fold. But it was his last work, this one,” he held up the manuscript Brother Chevalier handed him, “that could shake the very foundations of our faith. It is why I commissioned Brother Chevalier to retrieve the work, so that it may not fall into the hands of heretics and fanatics.”
      “Why do we even disgrace our table with such works? Why not just burn the book?” A younger brother of the order demanded. Quite a few Brothers agreed with the younger one.
      “I am in agreement that the book advocates heretical connotations, but to burn it would be to condemn our good brother who wrote those words. That I cannot allow. He has been a devout member of our community and one of the most ardent supporters of Christ Our Lord and the Holy See. I will not allow his name and reputation to suffer over this manuscript. In it, our dear brother prophesizes about the very heart of our faith, and the precise moment we shall meet our Lord and Savior.” Father Francisco placed the Manuscript in front of him on the table, “Within these pages lay the truths of Christendom, certain truths forecasting the end of this world and the beginning of a new everlasting divinity. As it is now, none but us are aware of its existence. It will remain that way until the end of days. Procured safely, with other works of great importance, inside The Philosopher’s Library.”
      A chorus of murmurs echoed from around the table.
      “That library is full of untruths and fanatical rants from overzealous free-thinkers,” One brother opposed.
      “Our faith has no business assimilating with the likes of those heretics!” Shouted another.
      The Master continued, “I understand your apprehension. If I did not think that this was the best recourse of action most beneficial to our faith, I too would voice similar concerns. Which is why, I have sent for someone responsible for keeping the secrets of that Library concealed. He has assured me that the manuscript will be safe. Never to be seen, nor spoken of again by outsiders. Our faithful brother’s name will not be tarnished.”
      A knock on the solid, oak door confirmed the Master's words. A brother at the far end of the table rose to his feet and opened the door. A few whispers between the two, then the brother stepped aside and the stranger entered.
      The man was dressed in a black, hooded, wool robe, his hands together, hidden inside opposite sleeves. He gave a curt nod to Father Francisco revealing the seal of his Order, which hung around his neck. It was an iron cross in the center of a circle with hands, symbolically, in prayer. Those in the religious community knew the seal. It was the seal of The Order of the Servants of Secrets.
      To Father Vicente Francisco the symbol was personal. For a time, in his youth, he had served with them. While there, he spent his time learning the secrets of their faith, serving humanity for better or worse. The Servants of Secrets were trusted with the world’s most sacred knowledge. Many of the world’s most ancient works survive within the walls of the Philosopher’s Library. Some of Aristotle and Plato’s earliest works are among the hundreds of ancient works that one can find there- works written long ago by the founders of Neo-Platonism, Plotinus, and Ammonius Saccas. Even mysterious texts belonging to a secret ancient organization called the Brethren of Purity, whose ancient origins are still unknown, are said to be hidden somewhere in the Library’s great halls. But, it was not just philosopher’s who’s works could be found there. Works by great Greek and Roman historians like Herodotus, Thucydides, Quintus Curtius Rufus, and Plutarch just to name a few could also be found there. Even modern scholars like Geoffrey of Monmouth Maimonides Augustine of Hippo Roger Bacon and Albertus Magnus research and texts hid deep within the secret Library.""",

      It was all over, in a matter of minutes. That's the ironic part.
      There were three of us: my best mates, Catherine and Vanessa, and myself. We'd been going to the local youth club for a couple of years, at the time.
      It was okay. I mean, there were trendier places to hang out, on a Friday night. But, when you're thirteen, and have the misfortune to look it...
      Remember those Panda drinks? Coke or shandy - take your pick. Both were cheap, and somewhat nasty. That was what they served at what they termed “the bar”, although it wasn't one, as far as I was concerned - not if you couldn't purchase a pint of Stella or a bottle of Bud there.
      They did, however, sell barely edible “Pink Shrimps”, which retailed at 2p each. Alternatively, there were “White Mice” - a totally inedible bargain, at 1p per “Mouse”. Ideal for lobbing at the acne-covered twelve- to fifteen-year-old “hunks”, whom my friends and I were far too shy to chat up, as such.
      The Club held discos, once a month. The three of us would dutifully, and somewhat unconvincingly, prance around, pretending to be Madonna, whenever the DJ played her latest hits, such as “Like a Virgin”, “Material Girl”, and “Into the Groove”. In retrospect, he didn't play much else.
      Well, there were the slow songs, of course. As none of us had boyfriends, we'd sit those ones out. Along with the inevitable “Crazy For You”, there were “Careless Whisper” and “Move Closer”.
      I don't think the DJ could have had a particularly large record collection. Probably worked for our local radio station, come to think of it, as the playlist was almost identical.  
      Cath's elder sister, Tracy, helped out at the club, on a voluntary basis. Vanessa was, of late, incapable of acting like a sane human being, in Tracy's presence. This was on account of her jealousy - of Tracy's, unquestionably gorgeous, fiance, Matt. Catherine fancied him, too. I was the only one who didn't.

      "story": """Some Gentle Persuasion
Before we begin to study the life and teaching of Jesus Christ, let us ask a very basic question. Is it possible? Can we, with any reasonable degree of confidence, find some starting point that no one will dispute? Or do we have to make some act of faith even before we begin? There may be many reading this book who do not yet feel ready to commit themselves to an act of faith. They would want to question whether Jesus Christ ever existed even, let alone believe any and every story with which they are presented that claims to describe something He said or did. So we shall begin with two things that cannot be doubted: the existence of the Christian Church and the writings of the New Testament. And we shall see how far back in history we can trace the existence of each.

The Existence of Christianity
If one were to be permitted to assume the accuracy of Christian writings, one could show that the Christian Church came into existence about the year A.D. 29. But it might be argued that these should be disregarded if one is to enquire absolutely impartially into this question. Therefore, for the present, we will ignore them, and see what evidence is left. About A.D. 112 a Roman called Pliny, engaged in the administration of the province of Bithynia (part of the country we now call Turkey), had a problem on his hands. He was not sure how to treat the outlawed Christians and so he wrote to the emperor, Trajan, asking for advice on the matter. Here is part of his letter:
‘Meanwhile, this is the course that I have adopted in the case of those brought before me as Christians. I ask them if they are Christians. If they admit it I repeat the question a second and a third time, threatening capital punishment; if they persist I sentence them to death .... There were others who displayed a like madness and whom I reserved to be sent to Rome, since they were Roman citizens.’
Other parts of the letter give us valuable information about Christian practice and indicate how widespread Christianity then was.
‘Others who recanted declared that the sum of their guilt or error had amounted only to this, that on an appointed day they had been accustomed to meet before daybreak, and recite a hymn antiphonally to Christ, as to a god, and to bind themselves by an oath, not for the commission of any crime but to abstain from theft, robbery, adultery and breach of faith, and not to deny a deposit when it was claimed. After the conclusion of the ceremony it was their custom to depart and meet again to take food .... The contagion of this superstition has spread not only in the cities, but in the villages and rural districts as well; yet it seems capable of being checked and set right. There is no shadow of doubt that the temples, which have been almost deserted, are beginning to be frequented once more, that the sacred rites which have been long neglected are being renewed, and that sacrihcial victims are for sale everywhere, whereas, till recently, a buyer was rarely to be found.’
We are also fortunate enough to possess Trajan’s reply to Pliny’s letter, in which he confirms Pliny’s policy.
However, we can take evidence of Christianity’s existence even closer to the date of A.D. 29 by reference to other Roman writers. About the time that Pliny wrote his letter to Trajan, the Roman historian Tacitus was writing his history of the Roman Empire. He gave an account of the great fire in Rome in A.D. 64. Many suspected that the emperor Nero himself had caused the fire. Tacitus wrote:
‘But all the endeavours of men, all the emperor’s largesse and the propitiations of the gods, did not suffice to allay the scandal or banish the belief that the fire had been ordered. And so, to get rid of the rumour Nero set up as the culprits and punished with the utmost rennements of cruelty a class hated for their abominations, who are commonly called Christians. Christus, from whom their name is derived, was executed at the hands of the procurator Pontius Pilate in the reign of Tiberius. Checked for the moment, this pernicious superstition again broke out, not only in Judea, the source of the evil, but even in Rome, that receptacle for everything that is sordid and degrading from every quarter of the globe which there finds a following’ The abusive way in which Tacitus refers to Christianity shows that he is in no way sympathetic to it, and the language used completely banishes the possibility that some Christian has tampered with the text of Tacitus’ writings to introduce material not originally there. Besides, another Roman historian, Suetonius, writing a few years later than Tacitus (about A.D. 120), confirms the Neronian persecution of Christians: ‘In his reign many abuses were severely punished and repressed, and as many new laws instituted .... Punishment was inflicted on Christians, a set of men adhering to a novel and mischievous superstition.’
Suetonius also mentioned that in the reign of Claudius (probably about A.D. 50) ‘ ... since the Jews were continually making disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus, he [Claudius] expelled them from Rome.’ Chrestus could be a variant spelling of Christus, and it may well be that in this statement of Suetonius (compare Acts 18.2) we have a reference to quarrels between Jewish and Christian leaders in Rome.
A third non-Christian historian must be mentioned. He is Josephus, a Jew who after a chequered career settled down to sustained literary activity in Rome. Among his writings are a History of the Jewish War (covering from 170 B.C. to A.D. 70) and his twenty-book-long Jewish Antiquities, which he completed in A.D. 93. He refers to many figures who are prominent in the New Testament: Pilate, Annas and Caiaphas, John the Baptist, James the brother of Jesus, and Jesus himself. One passage from the Jewish Antiquities deserves particular attention (it is quoted here in the form put forward by Professor Bruce in his book, The New Testament Documents):
‘And there arose about this time a source of new troubles, one Jesus, a wise man. He was a doer of marvellous deeds, a teacher of men who receive strange things with pleasure. He led away many Jews, and also many of the Greeks. This man was the so-called Christ. And when Pilate had condemned him to the cross on his impeachment by the chief men among us, those who had loved him at first did not cease; for he appeared to them, as they said, on the third day alive again, the divine prophets having spoken these and thousands of other wonderful things about him, and even now the tribe of Christians, so named after him, has not yet died out.’
Let us now try to assess what we know of Christianity by reference only to non-Christian writers whose works were published while personal memories and public records could verify their trustworthiness, remembering that none of these writers showed any sympathy for Christianity. The following facts are established: that under the procuratorship of Pilate over Judea (that is to say sometime between A.D. 26 and 36) a man called Jesus, and given the title Christ (in Latin Christus) by his followers, was crucified; that his followers believed he rose from the dead; that there were followers of his commonly called Christians, in Rome by A.D. 50 probably, and by A.D. 64 certainly; that Christians by A.D. 112 had become so widespread as to be a problem even in a comparatively remote part of the vast Roman Empire. This ‘problem’ was never solved, by the way, for Christianity eventually became the official religion of the Roman Empire.
Now the existence of a Christian Church in the terms just described is more signiflcant than might at first sight appear. For it compels us to ask how it might have come about. How was it that there were men who believed that their leader had risen from the dead? How was it that many Christians were prepared to suffer death, often a very cruel death, rather than recant their beliefs? If we are ever going to find out how these things could be, and they are happening still in the twentieth century as well as in the first, sooner or later we are going to have to examine the documents of Christianity, the writings of those who first held these beliefs. No doubt we shall feel that the obvious starting point is those writings which give an account of the life and teachings of the man whom Pliny tells us the Christians worshipped as god. That is what this book will help us to do, but a few things need to be said about these documents before we can begin.

The New Testament Writings
The most compelling thing about the Christian documents is that they exist. There are billions, literally, of Bibles in the world, translated, in whole or in part, into over one thousand different languages. It has often been the work of a lifetime to provide the Bible (or part of it) in a new language. Men and women today of the highest intellect are devoting their whole lives, often at great sacrifice of comfort and security, to translating, producing, and distributing the Bible; and these are men and women who are aware of, and have studied, the results of two centuries of intense critical scrutiny of the Bible. For the books of the Bible have been subjected to every test that the mind of man can devise, historical, textual, literary, and scientific. And it is still the world’s bestseller.
These facts, I trust, will make us want to know more. How did the New Testament (leaving aside the Old Testament, which is not really within the scope of this book) come to be written? Do we have the original writings, and, if not, how can we be sure that we have accurate copies? In fact, and this is a question that I have actually been asked, how can we be sure that the New Testament is not the work of some monk — or crank — in the Middle Ages ?
The New Testament consists of twenty-seven separate writings. They were all written in Greek, which was the language that nearly every one in the first century knew, at least partially, in addition to his own native language or dialect. Most of them are letters: thirteen of them bearing the name of Paul, one anonymous, one of James, two of Peter, three attributed to John, and one of Jude. Of the remaining six writings one (the Revelation of John) is of rather a special nature, containing seven separate letters within it and the account of a prolonged vision, one is an account of the growth of Christianity up to A.D. 62, and the other four are accounts of the life of Jesus Christ — the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
Now the men who wrote these letters and gospels apparently never for one moment thought they were contributing towards a handbook on Christianity which, when completed, would bear the title ‘The New Testament’. The letters, by and large, were written by the apostles as a means of dealing with a particular situation. Most were intended for a particular community of Christians, though some were intended for a limited or more general circulation. Four of Paul’s letters were written to individual men. None of the letters of the New Testament was a literary work — they were plain letters written for the same reason that any letter is written: because a personal visit is impracticable or impossible; the majority of Paul’s letters, for example, were written when the apostle was in prison.
The background to the gospels and the Acts of the Apostles is somewhat different. Here it will be best to take them one by one. The first gospel to be written, most scholars believe, was that of Mark. It was written probably some time between A.D. 60 and 65, in other words about thirty years after the events it describes. The reason for this long time lag is simple. The early Christians did not need written documents describing the life and teachings of Jesus Christ because of the many eye-witnesses who could personally recount what they knew. They did not feel it necessary, at first, to provide some permanent record because they believed that the end of the world (with the return of Jesus Christ) would come within a few years, certainly within their own lifetime. As time passed these eye-witnesses began to die off and when in A.D. 64 Christianity was declared an illegal religion, for which the penalty was death, the need for written permanent records of the testimony of the remaining eye-witnesses became most urgent. Papias, who was bishop of Hierapolis about A.D. 130, tells us, on the authority of John the Elder, the following about Mark’s Gospel:
‘Mark became the interpreter of Peter and he wrote down accurately, but not in order, as much as he remembered [or, as he (Peter) related] of the sayings and doings of Christ. For he was not a hearer or a follower of the Lord, but afterwards, as I said, of Peter, who adapted his teachings to the needs of the moment and did not make an ordered exposition of the sayings of the Lord. And so Mark made no mistake when he wrote down some things as he remembered [or, as he (Peter) related] them; for he made it his especial care to omit nothing of what he heard, and to make no false statement therein.’
These words of Papias are supported by other second century writers as well as by an examination of the gospel itself, which accords very well with the view that it is the record by another hand of the recollections of Peter.
Two of the other three, Matthew and Luke, have much in common with Mark, so that these three gospels are often called ‘Synoptic’, meaning that they can be viewed together. In fact it seems extremely likely that both the author of Matthew’s Gospel and Luke had Mark’s Gospel in front of them when they wrote their accounts of the life of Jesus Christ. For of the 661 verses of Mark’s Gospel (the last twelve and five others singly are later additions) about 600 are to be found, abridged but more or less unchanged, in Matthew and about 380 in Luke. Matthew and Luke also generally follow Mark’s order — so that occasionally Matthew diverges from Mark and Luke, and Luke from Mark and Matthew, but never do Matthew and Luke together diverge from Mark’s order.
Besides using Mark as a source, Matthew and Luke appear to have another common source, for apart from what we presume they borrowed from Mark there are about 250 verses which are common to both. Nothing certain is known of this source, which scholars refer to as ‘Q.’, from the German word for source, Quelle. It is a theoretical document that is held to exist because this is the easiest way of explaining how Matthew and Luke have these 250 or so verses in common which do not appear in Mark. However, it has been suggested that ‘Q.’ might well be an early composition of Matthew, which was later incorporated by an unknown writer in the gospel traditionally ascribed to Matthew, as well as used by Luke. The evidence for such a document again comes from Papias:
‘So then Matthew recorded the oracles [or sayings, or discourses - the Greek word is Logia] in the Hebrew tongue and each interpreted them to the best of his ability.’
If it is true that this compilation of Matthew is to be identified with ‘Q.’, it would explain how the first gospel came to be ascribed to Matthew, for many scholars find it difficult to believe that the final version, as found in our Bibles, was wholly the work of Matthew, because of the extent of its dependence upon Mark. Indeed it would have been strange for one of the original twelve apostles, and an eye-witness of Jesus, to have used so much of the work of a man who was neither of these.
Luke’s Gospel was the first part of a two-part work, the second part being the Acts of the Apostles. Luke was Paul’s companion in much of his journeyings and obtained a great deal of his material for the Acts from him. As regards his gospel, in addition to what we have already noted, Luke’s own words tell us more of the background of his writing:
Seeing that many have attempted to draw up a narrative of the facts which are received with full assurance among us on the authority of those who were from the beginning eye-witnesses and were devoted to the service of the divine Message, it has seemed right to me also, after careful investigation of the facts from their commencement, to write for you, most noble Theophilus, a connected account, that you may fully know the truth of the things which you have been taught by word of mouth.
It is impossible to state with any confidence exactly the date of Matthew and Luke, but a date for both somewhere near A.D. 70 would probably be not far wrong.
When one comes to John’s Gospel one enters upon a topic of a complexity beyond the scope of this introduction. There has been much discussion concerning its authorship and date, but in spite of this there do not, to the present writer at any rate, seem to be any really compelling reasons for rejecting the traditional view: that it was written, or caused to be written, by the apostle John some time after the other three, say around A.D. 90, at Ephesus. It seems probable that John knew the other gospels and did not want to go over ground already covered, for only one story outside the narrative of the crucifixion and resurrection appears in John which also appears in the others. John’s Gospel is a very personal account of specially chosen events, and often it is difficult to know whether the words used are meant to be taken as those of Jesus or those of the author himself. While the other gospels seem, in many ways, intended for those already Christians — Matthew has a very Jewish outlook, Mark less so, and Luke a distinctly Gentile orientation — John’s Gospel seems directed at the non-Christian and was written, the author states, that the reader ‘might believe’.
This, very briefly, is how the gospels particularly, and the New Testament as a whole, came to be written. Of course these conclusions are based on internal as well as external evidence. But they are the sort of considerations, which, if applied by historians to any other book of comparable antiquity, would be accepted as having an undeniable validity.
With this information we can now go on to the question of how sure we can be that what we find today written in our Bibles does in fact correspond accurately to what was originally set down by the authors of the New Testament. In spite of what has been said in describing the content of the New Testament, there may still be the suspicion in some minds that it is all a clever hoax.

The Manuscripts of the New Testament
As we have said, there are billions of Bibles in existence today. There are probably very few readers of this book who do not possess one, or have access to one. It is also probable that the copy you possess is a translation of the original Greek and Hebrew, in which the writers of the Biblical books wrote, called the Authorized Version. This translation was completed in 1611 and used the works of previous translators, mainly Tyndale, and, to a much lesser degree, Coverdale. These men were the first to translate the Bible into English directly from the original languages. The very few previous translations, for example that of Wycliffe, had been from a Latin version of the Bible called the Vulgate.
Now the history of Biblical manuscripts is a large subject, so it will help if we leave aside the Old Testament and concentrate on the New. Before printing came to Europe in the fifteenth century all books were written by hand; the word ‘manuscript’ means, strictly speaking, something written by hand. The making of books before printing was used was an extremely laborious business, and books were very scarce and very expensive, and normally were only to be found in places like monasteries, universities, and palaces. The first printed version of the New Testament in its original Greek was produced by Erasmus in 1516. His work was based on those manuscripts which he had been able to collect, and it was this that Tyndale used. Since 1516 there have been many publications of the Greek New Testament, as the discovery of more ancient manuscripts made some small changes seem desirable. An up-to-date copy today would include all the most recent findings, and would represent the result of meticulous comparisons made by thousands of scholars since Erasmus’ day. But what do we know of the New Testament prior to 1516? How many of the manuscripts written before that date survive to this day, and just how old are they?
One can answer these questions fairly exactly. There are about five thousand manuscripts containing either the whole or part of the New Testament, and they date from the first half of the second century onwards. The earliest fragment, containing a few verses from John’s Gospel, has been dated at around A.D. 130. Manuscripts containing parts of Luke, John, and the letters of Peter and Jude, are dated around A.D. 200. There are third-century manuscripts with more or less the rest of the New Testament. The material on which these writings were copied is called papyrus. It was made from a reed which grew largely in Egypt; strips of the pith were glued over strips placed at right angles to them, to make separate sheets which were then glued together into rolls which varied in length according to the needs of the writer, up to a maximum of about thirty feet. Papyrus will only survive under certain conditions of dry climate, such as those found in Egypt or Palestine. That some papyri have survived so long is a remarkable thing. However, in the fourth century another writing material, which had not been used a great deal previously, came into popular use. This was vellum, what we would call parchment, made from the skins of suitable animals. Vellum was arranged in leaves placed on top of each other and bound like a modern book. Such a book is called a codex. Another most important event of the fourth century was the recognition by the Roman Emperor Constantine of Christianity as a permissible religion in 313, which was soon followed by its adoption as the Roman Empire’s official religion. This naturally caused a great demand for the Christian writings to be made widely available, and many codices of the New Testament were produced. Vellum survives much more readily than papyrus, and from the fourth century onwards we have ample manuscript evidence of the text of the New Testament. There is a complete vellum copy of the New Testament dated as fourth century in the British Museum, for example, (it is called the Codex Sinaiticus) and another almost complete New Testament codex in the Vatican Library (the Codex Vaticanus). We possess four codices dated as fifth century, one of which is in the Cambridge University Library. And so on ... to detail the evidence after these dates is clearly unnecessary. Besides pieces of paper on which the New Testament has been copied out, and which by modern methods can be dated with considerable accuracy, there is another form of evidence which is very valuable. This is where we possess writings which can be dated by the lifetime of their authors, and usually much more precisely than that, and which actually quote parts of the New Testament. Thus a letter written by Clement, bishop of Rome, around a.D. 96, has quotations from ten books of the New Testament, possibly more. About the same number of books (but not all the same ones) have quotations from them appearing in a letter written by Ignatius, bishop of Antioch, in A.D. 115. In a letter written by Polycarp to the Philippians around A.D. 120 sixteen books of the New Testament appear in quotation. From then on throughout the second century there are writings which quote from all the books of the New Testament. Clearly, from all this is is impossible to believe that the New Testament was written later than the second half of the first century, with the majority of the books written within forty years of the events they describe, in other words within the lifetime of many thousands of eye-witnesses.

Conclusion
The point of this introduction has been to show that there are certain things that we just cannot dismiss. There can be no doubt that Jesus really lived, that certain people were willing to die for the belief that he had risen from the dead and was the Son of God, and that the stories of Jesus’ deeds and words were spread, both orally and in writing, while it was easily possible to verify their truth. It is of course still possible for us to hold that these beliefs were mistaken, but we would be very narrow-minded if we decided in advance of studying the records that this was the case. The scientific method of study is first observation, then the forming of a theory to explain the observed facts, and finally the testing of the theory. Our first task must be to find out what the gospels actually say.
How can we then find out what really happened, as it all happened so long ago? The job of a historian is very difiicult. When all the documents relating to a particular event have been studied, and obvious inconsistencies ruled out, he must in the end work on probabilities. Given my knowledge of human behaviour, he asks himself, what is the most likely thing to have happened in this situation? And even then he knows he is not always going to be right. This leads us to one crucial question — that of miracles. Many assume that a miracle is, by dehnition, something that cannot happen, and they therefore refuse ever to believe in one. The word ‘miracle’ actually means simply ‘something wonderful’, and we often use it in everyday language in this way, talking of, for example, ‘the miracles of modern science’. When Christians talk about miracles in the gospels, they do not mean that the scientifically observable laws of nature were suspended; they believe rather that there was another factor operating which must be taken into account, namely the direct activity of God. If this really was so, if it is true that in the person of Jesus Christ the God of creation was literally present on earth, what would we expect to happen? It seems to me that it would be more surprising that nothing wonderful should happen.
If Jesus was nothing more than an ordinary human being, I agree, miracles would be a real problem. The important question is — was he ? How can we decide on that? In two ways, I think. First we can study the gospels with a view to judging for ourselves, weighing the probabilities as a historian would, whether it is more consistent to look on Jesus as merely human or a great deal more than human. Some one has pointed out that if Jesus was not what he said he was, then either he was insane or else the cruellest man in history, knowingly to lead so many astray — to put it more simply, either mad or bad.
The second way of answering the question is based on one’s own experience. Christians are usually not convinced that Jesus is the Son of God merely on the grounds of their historical judgment. They find that in responding to the claims of Christ and opening their hearts to him, they do grasp a reality. They are aware within them of a friend, and a transformation of themselves, gradually, painfully sometimes, and never magically, with fear giving place to trust and selfishness to love. It is this transforming friendship that confirms their first tentative hopes of a transforming friend.
In this book no one is preaching at you, or trying to bend your mind to think in a particular way. The hope simply is to give you the opportunity of making your own mind up about the one who, by any reckoning, is the most important figure in history.""",

It sometimes amazed her how she made it to the tube station on time every day. She pushed these thoughts and those of the previous evening out of her mind and fixed her mental energies on finding the jacket to her black trouser suit.
She knew that the steaming cup of coffee she carried around as she searched would go untouched as would the two slices of toast on the kitchen table which were already going cold, uneaten.
The jacket located, the coffee abandoned she closed the door behind her. The Yale lock snapped as the door slammed shut. The house was now empty and quiet. The coffee still steaming in the mug, the toast going cold on the kitchen table.
The night before had started well. The restaurant was quiet; after all it was a Sunday night. The lack of clientele gave them a chance to talk, a chance to get to know each other a little better. He of course had chosen the location and had shown a degree of taste; could this bode well for the future?
Their first meeting was fraught with the awkwardness of mutual attraction and the burden of age pressing on their very souls. An eternity of exchanged glances had passed between the two of them. Who would make the first move? As tradition dictates he made the primary contact. A rendezvous had been arranged and now here they were, sitting either side of the three-foot by three foot square of wooden table top, the rules of engagement were beginning to be drawn.
As the first course arrived the conversation was flirtatious, but disjointed. She would interrupt, apologise and then giggle. He would be the true gentleman and insist on her continuing. Plates empty, one set of cutlery down and the wine beginning to take effect, the conversation loosened somewhat. The couple opened up a little and expressed some of their innermost thoughts and feeling to one another.
His opening gambit had been the usual male tack. His likes - cricket, golf, football, basically sport in general. There were no surprises either in his choice of favourite consumables - real ale and curry. His career, however, did have a spark of something out of the ordinary. - A TV producer. She pursued this part of conversation asking what he had worked on? It emerged, nothing outstanding; Open University, a handful of children's programs - none of them known to her.
Apart from the TV Producer aspect of his tale, he could have been any member of the male species recounting his interests.
The main course arrived, holding off the approaching moment when she must respond with her story of loneliness. To her colleagues and friends her apparent lack of male attention was a mystery. She was, after all, an attractive woman, although she had seen thirty four summers, she could well have been mistaken for ten years her junior.
As their plates began to empty, so her tale began to unfold. Having graduated from Oxford with a first in history she gravitated towards a career in academia. After one year of C.V.'s, interviews and rejection letters she hadn't received any serious job offers and was becoming despondent.
It had been her mother, always logical, always right, that had come up with the idea of a career path for her daughter.
The question was finally asked, he seemed interested to know. The truth came out.
After the dessert, coffee and a promise to arrange another meeting, the couple parted. The capital flashed past as the taxi headed home. In her heart she knew that they would not meet again, not as a couple. So what! She had work in the morning and what was another one down. She'd enjoyed the meal and yes, even the company. It would be easy for her to be upset or even chastise herself for not trying harder to impress him, but why, it's his loss.
The next morning she passed the answer phone machine and didn't give it a second glance as the light flashed continuously. It was getting late; the tube wouldn't wait for her. The house was a mess, not in its normal state of pristine tidiness.

Reconsidering Abraham and Isaac
The story of a man willing to slaughter his own son out of a sense of blind obedience  strikes  most  people  as  rather  horrific  nowadays. Some  especially religious  individuals  are  prepared  to  offer  justifications  grounded  in  abstruse arguments about faith but these aren’t even convincing on a personal level – none of the people who I’ve seen make such arguments have impressed upon me the lack of conscience and mercy necessary to convince me that they proselytize them in genuine confidence. Rather what appears to be happening is that people, eager to retain a personally sustaining belief in the bible, resort to a self-confounding sophistry  in  order  to reconcile  something  grotesque  with  their  emotionally invested belief in the god of said text. Atheists naturally mock this kind of thing and cite it as an example of the absurdity and moral hypocrisy of religious belief. As far as my own personal experience though, I’ve never seen an atheist, or any skeptic, disagreeing with the standard religious interpretations that prevail here. They seem content to accept the existing religious analysis of the story while merely drawing an opposite conclusion – rather than seeing Abraham as an example of virtuous faith then they see him as symbolic of the intellectual poison that constitutes faith in general. But what if both groups misunderstand the story? 
The Offering of Isaac constitutes a very brief episode in the book of Genesis and yet this has provided a continuously renewed sense of moral anxiety for western civilization since the advent of Christianity. For some reason the story troubles many of us. Not only does it elude an easy understanding but even where claims are made to possessing a correct interpretation, these claims tend to be made without equal certainty in their comprehensiveness or definitiveness. Why would God test anyone in such a way? Is God so blind to the truth in our hearts that we must be put on trial? The thread being unravelled from this question threatens to unspool the whole fabric of theology, potentially undermining the concept of any biblically grounded divinity – for an atheist of course such a thing simply confirms their own pre-existing biases. For an atheist, God isn’t a mystery, God’s a delusion – so only a believer can confront the mystery of God. But this doesn’t mean that mere belief in God will necessarily result in a confrontation with the real mystery here. That is to say, we may think that we don’t understand God and still misunderstand the scope of our own misunderstanding. Similarly, I think the story of The Offering of Isaac is so fundamentally misunderstood that the confusion most people correlate with it is a confusion that fails to actually engage the story’s genuine mystery. 
What God asks of Abraham doesn’t make sense. Most religious readers will try to make sense of it but, if they can create any “sense” from this, maybe that only shows that they’ve distorted the story’s real significance? Why should the infinite make any sense at all? Should the hypothetical source of all the complexity and wonder in the universe be casually intelligible? Should the motives of the almighty reveal themselves to us without extraordinary effort? Once we appreciate how ridiculous it is to expect the nature of God to be easily understood, the usual objections and explanations slathered over Abraham and Isaac by atheists and theists alike reveal how insipid they really are. Perhaps God is a bit subtle? Perhaps anything that is comprehended in a single afternoon of idle thought is, ipso facto, sufficient proof that it expresses nothing real about the divine? This is the point of departure where my alternative reading of Abraham and Isaac begins. It starts with not assuming that God wanted Abraham to obey. 
Is morality primarily a form of obedience? Then it’s merely a submission to authority. How would such an authority be recognized though? Even if you believe in absolute obedience to God, it still raises the question of what can be recognized as an authentic command from them. Some people will make the argument that God wouldn’t allow a false command to masquerade as an authentic one but, supposing that’s true, it would still be a truth arrived at through some form of internal justification independent of an external command. Clearly then a person can only obey a divine command, simply because it’s a divine command, if their own conscience assents to this – if through some self-process they’ve first managed to subordinate themselves to the concept of obeying God unequivocally. Unless of course they’re fated to obeying God but in that case no choice is being made and so the obedience in question has no moral significance. Morality therefore is absolutely grounded within the domain of personal choice, not authority, and no amount of self-subordination can ever erase the underlying foundations of conscience it relies on. We are ultimately responsible for everything we willfully do, no matter what.""",

The sun had just come out: the ripples were being repeated as a network of light on the cedar uprights and supports, on the lintel and across part of the ceiling. A chiffchaff began to sing from the leafless sallows. Lord Heite looked down again, at the water, and breathed deeply. He was at peace. He had made the right decision.
A dry branch snapped on the path behind the pavilion. His bodyguards were waiting at a distance, on duty in the grove. They had let his guest come through. 
“Please join me, General Teshe,” he said, and looked round. 
The general mounted the steps and, bringing his bulky form to a halt, gave a correct but informal salute. His eyes were friendly; his broad, blond-bearded features were about to break into a smile. He had been travelling all night, but he looked, as ever, immaculate. The grey leather of his dress armour creaked softly as he accepted the unspoken invitation to seat himself beside his lord. In the regulation manner he drew about him his finely woven cloak, grey and darker grey, edged with black serpents along the hem. His kneeboots gleamed. Even when seated, he kept his shoulders perfectly square; yet he was also at ease. There was something permanent about the man, timeless, infallible. It had been the same twenty years ago, when he and Lord Heite had been boys together at the academy. “Well, Kasha,” said Lord Heite, free now from the ears of his entourage. “Tell me. How are you?” 
“Growing older, liege.” The smile broadened; his teeth were white. “The pagans in my care would age even Heite Gehan.” 
“How did you once describe them? ‘Fractious’? Was that the word?” 
“Let us say that their resentment of authority is second only to their idleness.” “On the contrary, Kasha. You have tamed them remarkably quickly. The returns from your province tell me so.” 
“You flatter me, my lord. Much remains to be done.” 
“But not by you.” For a moment Lord Heite regarded the peaceful waters of the lake. Then he said, “Do you remember my kinsman, Brennis Gehan Fifth?” 
“Only vaguely.” 
“His father tried to make the island country independent of the mainland. When he inherited Valdoe, Brennis Fifth pursued much the same idea. We tolerated the position until he, fortunately or otherwise, went out of his mind. It then became necessary to replace him.” “With General Hewzane,” General Teshe recalled. 
“Exactly. That was seven years ago. Did you ever meet Torin Hewzane?” 
“Yes, my lord. He is of the Garland.” 
“Well, now of course he is Lord Brennis. Unlike you, Kasha, he lets such titles go to his head. I must say he has disappointed us. A mistake was made. We misjudged him.”
General Teshe sat forward, incredulous.""",

      "story":
          """Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter.
For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country.
Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,—a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter.
As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, 'Let me see the child, and die.'
The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed's head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him:
'Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.'
'Lor bless her dear heart, no!' interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.
'Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all on 'em dead except two, and them in the wurkus with me, she'll know better than to take on in that way, bless her dear heart! Think what it is to be a mother, there's a dear young lamb do.'
Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother's prospects failed in producing its due effect. The patient shook her head, and stretched out her hand towards the child.
The surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back—and died. They chafed her breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever. They talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.
'It's all over, Mrs. Thingummy!' said the surgeon at last.
'Ah, poor dear, so it is!' said the nurse, picking up the cork of the green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to take up the child. 'Poor dear!'
'You needn't mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,' said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. 'It's very likely it will be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.' He put on his hat, and, pausing by the bedside on his way to the door, added, 'She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?'
'She was brought here last night,' replied the old woman, 'by the overseer's order. She was found lying in the street. She had walked some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.'
The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand. 'The old story,' he said, shaking his head: 'no wedding-ring, I see. Ah! Good-night!'
The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.
What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was! Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society. But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once—a parish child—the orphan of a workhouse—the humble, half-starved drudge—to be cuffed and buffeted through the world—despised by all, and pitied by none.
Oliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan, left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he would have cried the louder.""",

      "story":
          """On August 13, 1813, Thomas Jefferson took up his pen to write to Isaac McPherson. It was a quiet week in Jefferson’s correspondence. He wrote a letter to Madison about the appointment of a tax assessor, attempted to procure a government position for an acquaintance, produced a fascinating and lengthy series of comments on a new “Rudiments of English Grammar,” discussed the orthography of nouns ending in “y,” accepted the necessary delay in the publication of a study on the anatomy of mammoth bones, completed a brief biography of Governor Lewis, and, in general, conﬁned himself nar-rowly in subject matter. But on the 13th of August, Jefferson’s mind was on intellectual property, and most speciﬁcally, patents.
Jefferson’s writing is, as usual, apparently effortless. Some ﬁnd his penmanship a little hard to decipher. To me, used to plowing through the frenzied chicken tracks that law students produce during exams, it seems perfectly clear. If handwriting truly showed the architecture of the soul, then Jefferson’s would conjure up Monticello or the University of Virginia. There are a few revisions and interlineations, a couple of words squeezed in with a caret at the bottom of the line, but for the most part the lines of handwriting simply roll on and on—“the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain,” to quote a phrase from the letter, caught in vellum and ink, though that brain has been dust for more than a century and a half.
I love libraries. I love the mushroom smell of gently rotting paper, the ﬂaky crackle of manuscripts, and the surprise of matching style of handwriting with style of thought. Today, though, I am viewing his letter over the Internet on a computer screen. (You can too. The details are at the back of the book.)
I think Jefferson would have been fascinated by the Internet. After all, this was the man whose library became the Library of Congress, who exempliﬁes the notion of the brilliant dabbler in a hundred ﬁelds, whose own book collection was clearly a vital and much consulted part of his daily existence, and whose vision of politics celebrates the power of an informed citizenry. Admit-tedly, the massive conﬂicts between Jefferson’s announced principles and his actions on the issue of slavery have led some, though not me, to doubt that there is any sincerity or moral instruction to be found in his words. But even those who ﬁnd him a sham can hardly fail to see the continual and obvious joy he felt about knowledge and its spread.
In the letter to Isaac McPherson, a letter that has become very famous in the world of the digerati, this joy becomes manifest. The initial subject of the correspondence seems far from the online world. McPherson wrote to Jeffer-son about “elevators, conveyers and Hopper-boys.” Speciﬁcally, he wanted to know Jefferson’s opinion of a patent that had been issued to Mr. Oliver Evans. Jefferson devotes a paragraph to a recent retrospective extension of patent rights (he disapproves) and then turns to Evans’s elevators.
Patents then, as now, were only supposed to be given for inventions that were novel, nonobvious, and useful. Jefferson had considerable doubt whether Evans’s device, essentially a revolving string of buckets used to move grain, actually counted as “an invention.” “The question then whether such a string of buckets was invented ﬁrst by Oliver Evans, is a mere question of fact in mathematical history. Now, turning to such books only as I happen to possess, I ﬁnd abundant proof that this simple machinery has been in use from time immemorial.” Jefferson cites from his library example after example of references to the “Persian wheel”—a string of buckets to move water. The display of scholar-ship is effortless and without artiﬁce. If the device existed to move water, he declares, Mr. Evans can hardly patent it to move grain. “If one person invents a knife convenient for pointing our pens, another cannot have a patent right for the same knife to point our pencils. A compass was invented for navigating the sea; another could not have a patent right for using it to survey land”.""",

Halfdan grew up in the small farming-town of Os, in the kingdom of Fjordane. He was fathered by Gødrød the Toothy and mothered by an outlander woman called Aasa.
As a young man, Gødrød had killed a few other local young men, for no reason other than boredom; as punishment for these wrongs, the Fjordane Assembly had sentenced Gødrød to three years as an outlaw. Forced into exile, Gødrød rode east across the mountains. After twelve years in the east -- when nobody in Os knew if he was still alive, and few even thought about him much anymore -- Gødrød had returned home with a surprising woman.
Aasa had very dark skin. Nobody in Os could remember ever seeing a person like her before. Aasa's hair was completely black, tightly curled, and formed a soft ball around her head. She said that she was from Nubia, a place far to the south that nobody here had ever heard of. All of the gossip-loving folk in Os wanted to know their story. How had they met? Briefly, this is what happened. Aasa's first husband had travelled with Aasa from Nubia to Constantinople, where he was a diplomat to the Roman Empress. Gødrød had also lived in Constantinople then. He had learned to speak Greek and to pretend to worship Christ; these qualities, and his skill with spear and ax, had earned him a job in Constantinople as a bodyguard for the Empress Irene. Gødrød and Aasa were often at the palace at the same time. Aasa's odd-looking and darkly beautiful face -- so different from Roman women, and from the pale and pointy-nosed girls he remembered from Os -- appealed to him. He spied on her, learning that Aasa was lonely and that her husband preferred boys. When Gødrød approached her, Aasa agreed.
They kept their love secret from everybody in Constantinople.
Until, long later, she became pregnant. Gødrød and Aasa knew that it would be impossible to hide her unfaithfulness when her belly started to bulge, as Aasa's first husband had not touched her in a long time. So Gødrød and Aasa stole as many treasures from the Empress and from Aasa's first husband as they could quickly get their hands on, fleeing Constantinople on horseback by night, to the west. Gødrød had spent the early years of his exile in Russia, and was able arrange a wedding in a Russian Christian church. The fugitives continued west on horseback, her belly growing bigger and bigger. After many adventures, including losing their horses and treasure to bandits in Lithuania, Gødrød guided his huge-bellied wife over Norway's eastern mountains and into the kingdom of Fjordane and to his home-town of Os.

          """Since the millennium, the United States had been plagued by twenty years of unrest, sparked by a large increase in income tax and the corrosive reports of Social Security's impending demise, along with tougher standards for education and the tidlewave of immigration. Crime in big cities burst out of all proportion, as people lashed out against what they considered un-American trends, and the White House was besieged by reports of decay on all fronts. Newly minted President Smith declared a state of martial law, and temporarily closed the borders of all states. In anticipation of an exodus, he and his staff formulated a Draconian measure-The Relocation Law-which only allowed married couples and their children, adopted or otherwise, to leave their environs. Demonized, President Smith nevertheless maintained that something drastic had to be introduced to save the greatest nation in the history of the world. Historians harkened back to the Revolutionary tax noose of Britain, and made a plea for clemency, arguing that the country was only suffering the temporary paranoia of a new millenium, prey to demons that just so happened to be universally shared.
New York kept a strict curfew in accordance with the Police State Act recently passed through Congress. This bill imposed a net after 6:00 p.m., and captives were incarcerated until morning(the Civil Liberties Union had vetoed the panther Sobriety Act, which would have illegalized alcohol; it had almost pounced on the masses before the unions could intercede). Individual states passed less stringent laws, which did not deter the sobering pattern of crime.
Los Angeles and New York were called "Terror Domes" by Ben and Ray, friends and local muscle in NY. The yearly homicide rate was now nearing one per fifty, due to the civil wars that only infrequently hit the suburbs. When persistent rumors flowered into actual seizures, they stuck especially close to each other, watching each other's backs. Ray always seemed to know which supposed cops were impersonators, and sometimes shot them preemptively. He would pull out their drivers' licenses afterward, pointing out the different faces, sometimes keeping the i.d.s, but always evenly splitting the money. Since grade school, they had been acquaintances, and had remained friends even through high school, when their neighborhoods went to war.
The outbreak occurred when they were in eleventh grade. At a recess they were surrounded, and told to fight each other. There were about thirty in all. They pulled out knives, and stood with feet wide apart, in what was called the "execution stand." Rain was pouring out of the sky, and little bits of hale bounced off their afros.
"Come on," said Ben. "It's too slippery for a good scrape. Can't you delay the executive order?"
"No go," replied the leader of both groups. He had a darker, and more smooth face than either Ben or Ray. He was one of those "dead-looking" brothers, with a shade of gray. He was tall and wiry, wearing a threadbare jacket with a huge, stiff collar(later, when the race wars touched Ben and Ray's sphere for the first time, he disappeared. He had an annoying habit of making loud clicking sounds between sentences. Ben and Ray used to joke that it was the sound he made as a baby sucking on his mother's teats. He was intelligent, though, and persuasive, which was why everyone followed him).
"Be reasonable, Tony," Ray said. "We're loyal to our groups. That's the main thing."
"No! Your relationship must be severed, as of today. This is the final, symbolic break for two neighborhoods. You two being friends mocks the virtue of the war."
"Virtue?" Ben said. "What is virtuous about war?"
"Loyalty to your tribe, brother, over everything else." Tony hissed. "Now you two cooperate with the executive decree. Unless you want to die, that is. And I must remind you that dying by knives is very painful."
Roy laughed and swung at Ben, who leaned back a bit too late. It caught m on the nose, and his feet slipped out from under him. His momentum brought him down on his head, and he came to with Ray cradling it. Tony was standing over him with a grin on his angular face. Ben struggled to get up, but Ray restrained him. Ben always kidded Ray about cheating, because otherwise he would have kicked his ass thoroughly.
For his part, Tony always said that is was a joke, and that his crew never had the intention of killing them in the first place. For many years afterward, there were rumors that he had founded a criminal empire somewhere in the Midwest, but there had never been any confirmation one way or another.""",

    "synopsis": """Mill aims to address the balance between individual freedom and societal control. He argues for the protection of individual liberties and autonomy, emphasizing that personal freedom should be limited only when it harms others.""",
    "story":"""The subject of this Essay is not the so-called Liberty of the Will, so unfortunately opposed to the misnamed doctrine of Philosophical Necessity; but Civil, or Social Liberty: the nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual. A question seldom stated, and hardly ever discussed, in general terms, but which profoundly influences the practical controversies of the age by its latent presence, and is likely soon to make itself recognised as the vital question of the future. It is so far from being new, that in a certain sense, it has divided mankind, almost from the remotest ages; but in the stage of progress into which the more civilised portions of the species have now entered, it presents itself under new conditions, and requires a different and more fundamental treatment.

The struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar, particularly in that of Greece, Rome, and England. But in old times this contest was between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the government. By liberty, was meant protection against the tyranny of the political rulers. The rulers were conceived (except in some of the popular governments of Greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic position to the people whom they ruled. They consisted of a governing One, or a governing tribe or caste, who derived their authority from inheritance or conquest, who, at all events, did not hold it at the pleasure of the governed, and whose supremacy men did not venture, perhaps did not desire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against its oppressive exercise. Their power was regarded as necessary, but also as highly dangerous; as a weapon which they would attempt to use against their subjects, no less than against external enemies. To prevent the weaker members of the community from being preyed upon by innumerable vultures, it was needful that there should be an animal of prey stronger than the rest, commissioned to keep them down. But as the king of the vultures would be no less bent upon preying on the flock than any of the minor harpies, it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude of defence against his beak and claws. The aim, therefore, of patriots, was to set limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered to exercise over the community; and this limitation was what they meant by liberty. It was attempted in two ways. First, by obtaining a recognition of certain immunities, called political liberties or rights, which it was to be regarded as a breach of duty in the ruler to infringe, and which if he did infringe, specific resistance, or general rebellion, was held to be justifiable. A second, and generally a later expedient, was the establishment of constitutional checks; by which the consent of the community, or of a body of some sort, supposed to represent its interests, was made a necessary condition to some of the more important acts of the governing power. To the first of these modes of limitation, the ruling power, in most European countries, was compelled, more or less, to submit. It was not so with the second; and to attain this, or when already in some degree possessed, to attain it more completely, became everywhere the principal object of the lovers of liberty. And so long as mankind were content to combat one enemy by another, and to be ruled by a master, on condition of being guaranteed more or less efficaciously against his tyranny, they did not carry their aspirations beyond this point.

A time, however, came, in the progress of human affairs, when men ceased to think it a necessity of nature that their governors should be an independent power, opposed in interest to themselves. It appeared to them much better that the various magistrates of the State should be their tenants or delegates, revocable at their pleasure. In that way alone, it seemed, could they have complete security that the powers of government would never be abused to their disadvantage. By degrees, this new demand for elective and temporary rulers became the prominent object of the exertions of the popular party, wherever any such party existed; and superseded, to a considerable extent, the previous efforts to limit the power of rulers. As the struggle proceeded for making the ruling power emanate from the periodical choice of the ruled, some persons began to think that too much importance had been attached to the limitation of the power itself. That (it might seem) was a resource against rulers whose interests were habitually opposed to those of the people. What was now wanted was, that the rulers should be identified with the people; that their interest and will should be the interest and will of the nation. The nation did not need to be protected against its own will. There was no fear of its tyrannising over itself. Let the rulers be effectually responsible to it, promptly removable by it, and it could afford to trust them with power of which it could itself dictate the use to be made. Their power was but the nation's own power, concentrated, and in a form convenient for exercise. This mode of thought, or rather perhaps of feeling, was common among the last generation of European liberalism, in the Continental section of which it still apparently predominates. Those who admit any limit to what a government may do, except in the case of such governments as they think ought not to exist, stand out as brilliant exceptions among the political thinkers of the Continent. A similar tone of sentiment might by this time have been prevalent in our own country, if the circumstan which for a time encouraged it, had continued unaltered.  became everywhere the principal object of the lovers of liberty.

A similar tone of sentiment might by this time have been prevalent in our own country, if the circumstances which for a time encouraged it, had continued unaltered.

But, in political and philosophical theories, as well as in persons, success discloses faults and infirmities which failure might have concealed from observation. The notion, that the people have no need to limit their power over themselves, might seem axiomatic, when popular government was a thing only dreamed about, or read of as having existed at some distant period of the past. Neither was that notion necessarily disturbed by such temporary aberrations as those of the French Revolution, the worst of which were the work of a usurping few, and which, in any case, belonged, not to the permanent working of popular institutions, but to a sudden and convulsive outbreak against monarchical and aristocratic despotism. In time, however, a democratic republic came to occupy a large portion of the earth's surface, and made itself felt as one of the most powerful members of the community of nations; and elective and responsible government became subject to the observations and criticisms which wait upon a great existing fact. It was now perceived that such phrases as "self-government," and "the power of the people over themselves," do not express the true state of the case. The "people" who exercise the power are not always the same people with those over whom it is exercised; and the "self-government" spoken of is not the government of each by himself, but of each by all the rest. The will of the people, moreover, practically means, the will of the most numerous or the most active part of the people; the majority, or those who succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority: the people, consequently, may desire to oppress a part of their number; and precautions are as much needed against this, as against any other abuse of power. The limitation, therefore, of the power of government over individuals, loses none of its importance when the holders of power are regularly accountable to the community, that is, to the strongest party therein. This view of things, recommending itself equally to the intelligence of thinkers and to the inclination of those important classes in European society to whose real or supposed interests democracy is adverse, has had no difficulty in establishing itself; and in political speculations "the tyranny of the majority" is now generally included among the evils against which society requires to be on its guard.

Like other tyrannies, the tyranny of the majority was at first, and is still vulgarly, held in dread, chiefly as operating through the acts of the public authorities. But reflecting persons perceived that when society is itself the tyrant—society collectively, over the separate individuals who compose it—its means of tyrannising are not restricted to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries. Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself. Protection, therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough: there needs protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling; against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them; to fetter the development, and, if possible, prevent the formation, of any individuality not in harmony with its ways, and compel all characters to fashion themselves upon the model of its own. There is a limit to the legitimate interference of collective opinion with individual independence: and to find that limit, and maintain it against encroachment, is as indispensable to a good condition of human affairs, as protection against political despotism.

But though this proposition is not likely to be contested in general terms, the practical question, where to place the limit—how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control—is a subject on which nearly everything remains to be done. All that makes existence valuable to any one, depends on the enforcement of restraints upon the actions of other people. Some rules of conduct, therefore, must be imposed, by law in the first place, and by opinion on many things which are not fit subjects for the operation of law. What these rules should be, is the principal question in human affairs; but if we except a few of the most obvious cases, it is one of those which least progress has been made in resolving. No two ages, and scarcely any two countries, have decided it alike; and the decision of one age or country is a wonder to another. Yet the people of any given age and country no more suspect any difficulty in it, than if it were a subject on which mankind had always been agreed. The rules which obtain among themselves appear to them self-evident and self-justifying. This all but universal illusion is one of the examples of the magical influence of custom, which is not only, as the proverb says, a second nature, but is continually mistaken for the first. The effect of custom, in preventing any misgiving respecting the rules of conduct which mankind impose on one another, is all the more complete because the subject is one on which it is not generally considered necessary that reasons should be given, either by one person to others, or by each to himself. People are accustomed to believe, and have been encouraged in the belief by some who aspire to the character of philosophers, that their feelings, on subjects of this nature, are better than reasons, and render reasons unnecessary. The practical principle which guides them to their opinions on the regulation of human conduct, is the feeling in each person's mind that everybody should be required to act as he, and those with whom he sympathises, would like them to act. No one, indeed, acknowledges to himself that his standard of judgment is his own liking; but an opinion on a point of conduct, not supported by reasons, can only count as one person's preference; and if the reasons, when given, are a mere appeal to a similar preference felt by other people, it is still only many people's liking instead of one. To an ordinary man, however, his own preference, thus supported, is not only a perfectly satisfactory reason, but the only one he generally has for any of his notions of morality, taste, or propriety, which are not expressly written in his religious creed; and his chief guide in the interpretation even of that. Men's opinions, accordingly, on what is laudable or blamable, are affected by all the multifarious causes which influence their wishes in regard to the conduct of others, and which are as numerous as those which determine their wishes on any other subject. Sometimes their reason—at other times their prejudices or superstitions: often their social affections, not seldom their anti-social ones, their envy or jealousy, their arrogance or contemptuousness: but most commonly, their desires or fears for themselves—their legitimate or illegitimate self-interest. Wherever there is an ascendant class, a large portion of the morality of the country emanates from its class interests, and its feelings of class superiority. The morality between Spartans and Helots, between planters and negroes, between princes and subjects, between nobles and roturiers, between men and women, has been for the most part the creation of these class interests and feelings: and the sentiments thus generated, react in turn upon the moral feelings of the members of the ascendant class, in their relations among themselves. Where, on the other hand, a class, formerly ascendant, has lost its ascendancy, or where its ascendancy is unpopular, the prevailing moral sentiments frequently bear the impress of an impatient dislike of superiority.

Where, on the other hand, a class, formerly ascendant, has lost its ascendancy, or where its ascendancy is unpopular, the prevailing moral sentiments frequently bear the impress of an impatient dislike of superiority. Another grand determining principle of the rules of conduct, both in act and forbearance, which have been enforced by law or opinion, has been the servility of mankind towards the supposed preferences or aversions of their temporal masters, or of their gods. This servility, though essentially selfish, is not hypocrisy; it gives rise to perfectly genuine sentiments of abhorrence; it made men burn magicians and heretics. Among so many baser influences, the general and obvious interests of society have of course had a share, and a large one, in the direction of the moral sentiments: less, however, as a matter of reason, and on their own account, than as a consequence of the sympathies and antipathies which grew out of them: and sympathies and antipathies which had little or nothing to do with the interests of society, have made themselves felt in the establishment of moralities with quite as great force.

The likings and dislikings of society, or of some powerful portion of it, are thus the main thing which has practically determined the rules laid down for general observance, under the penalties of law or opinion. And in general, those who have been in advance of society in thought and feeling have left this condition of things unassailed in principle, however they may have come into conflict with it in some of its details. They have occupied themselves rather in inquiring what things society ought to like or dislike, than in questioning whether its likings or dislikings should be a law to individuals. They preferred endeavouring to alter the feelings of mankind on the particular points on which they were themselves heretical, rather than make common cause in defence of freedom, with heretics generally. The only case in which the higher ground has been taken on principle and maintained with consistency, by any but an individual here and there, is that of religious belief: a case instructive in many ways, and not least so as forming a most striking instance of the fallibility of what is called the moral sense: for the odium theologicum, in a sincere bigot, is one of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling. Those who first broke the yoke of what called itself the Universal Church, were in general as little willing to permit difference of religious opinion as that church itself. But when the heat of the conflict was over, without giving a complete victory to any party, and each church or sect was reduced to limit its hopes to retaining possession of the ground it already occupied; minorities, seeing that they had no chance of becoming majorities, were under the necessity of pleading to those  been the servility of mankind towards the supposed preferences or aversions of their temporal masters, or of their gods.

It is accordingly on this battle-field, almost solely, that the rights of the individual against society have been asserted on broad grounds of principle, and the claim of society to exercise authority over dissentients, openly controverted. The great writers to whom the world owes what religious liberty it possesses, have mostly asserted freedom of conscience as an indefeasible right, and denied absolutely that a human being is accountable to others for his religious belief. Yet so natural to mankind is intolerance in whatever they really care about, that religious freedom has hardly anywhere been practically realised, except where religious indifference, which dislikes to have its peace disturbed by theological quarrels, has added its weight to the scale. In the minds of almost all religious persons, even in the most tolerant countries, the duty of toleration is admitted with tacit reserves. One person will bear with dissent in matters of church government, but not of dogma; another can tolerate everybody, short of a Papist or a Unitarian; another, every one who believes in revealed religion; a few extend their charity a little further, but stop at the belief in a God and in a future state. Wherever the sentiment of the majority is still genuine and intense, it is found to have abated little of its claim to be obeyed.

In England, from the peculiar circumstances of our political history, though the yoke of opinion is perhaps heavier, that of law is lighter, than in most other countries of Europe; and there is considerable jealousy of direct interference, by the legislative or the executive power, with private conduct; not so much from any just regard for the independence of the individual, as from the still subsisting habit of looking on the government as representing an opposite interest to the public. The majority have not yet learnt to feel the power of the government their power, or its opinions their opinions. When they do so, individual liberty will probably be as much exposed to invasion from the government, as it already is from public opinion. But, as yet, there is a considerable amount of feeling ready to be called forth against any attempt of the law to control individuals in things in which they have not hitherto been accustomed to be controlled by it; and this with very little discrimination as to whether the matter is, or is not, within the legitimate sphere of legal control; insomuch that the feeling, highly salutary on the whole, is perhaps quite as often misplaced as well grounded in the particular instances of its application. There is, in fact, no recognised principle by which the propriety or impropriety of government interference is customarily tested. People decide according to their personal preferences. Some, whenever they see any good to be done, or evil to be remedied, would willingly instigate the government to undertake the business; while others prefer to bear almost any amount of social evil, rather than add one to the departments of human interests amenable to governmental control. And men range themselves on one or the other side in any particular case, according to this general direction of their sentiments; or according to the degree of interest which they feel in the particular thing which it is proposed that the government should do, or according to the belief they entertain that the government would, or would not, do it in the manner they prefer; but very rarely on account of any opinion to which they consistently adhere, as to what things are fit to be done by a government. And it seems to me that in consequence of this absence of rule or principle, one side is at present as often wrong as the other; the interference of government is, with about equal frequency, improperly invoked and improperly condemned.

The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it is desired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else. The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.

It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others, must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury. For the same reason, we may leave out of consideration those backward states of society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage. The early difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great, that there is seldom any choice of means for overcoming them; and a ruler full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any expedients that will attain an end, perhaps otherwise unattainable. Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end. Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion. Until then, there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one. But as soon as mankind have attained the capacity of being guided to their own improvement by conviction or persuasion (a period long since reached in all nations with whom we need here concern ourselves), compulsion, either in the direct form or in that of pains and penalties for non-compliance, is no longer admissible as a means to their own good, and justifiable only for the security of others.

It is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be derived to my argument from the idea of abstract right, as a thing independent of utility. I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions; but it must be utility in the largest sense, grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being. Those interests, I contend, authorise the subjection of individual spontaneity to external control, only in respect to those actions of each, which concern the interest of other people. If any one does an act hurtful to others, there is a primâ facie case for punishing him, by law, or, where legal

I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethical questions; but it must be utility in the largest sense, grounded on the permanent interests of man as a progressive being. Those interests, I contend, authorise the subjection of individual spontaneity to external control, only in respect to those actions of each, which concern the interest of other people. If any one does an act hurtful to others, there is a primâ facie case for punishing him, by law, or, where legal penalties are not safely applicable, by general disapprobation. There are also many positive acts for the benefit of others, which he may rightfully be compelled to perform; such as, to give evidence in a court of justice; to bear his fair share in the common defence, or in any other joint work necessary to the interest of the society of which he enjoys the protection; and to perform certain acts of individual beneficence, such as saving a fellow-creature's life, or interposing to protect the defenceless against ill-usage, things which whenever it is obviously a man's duty to do, he may rightfully be made responsible to society for not doing. A person may cause evil to others not only by his actions but by his inaction, and in either case he is justly accountable to them for the injury. The latter case, it is true, requires a much more cautious exercise of compulsion than the former. To make any one answerable for doing evil to others, is the rule; to make him answerable for not preventing evil, is, comparatively speaking, the exception. Yet there are many cases clear enough and grave enough to justify that exception. In all things which regard the external relations of the individual, he is de jure amenable to those whose interests are concerned, and if need be, to society as their protector. There are often good reasons for not holding him to the responsibility; but these reasons must arise from the special expediencies of the case: either because it is a kind of case in which he is on the whole likely to act better, when left to his own discretion, than when controlled in any way in which society have it in their power to control him; or because the attempt to exercise control would produce other evils, greater than those which it would prevent. When such reasons as these preclude the enforcement of responsibility, the conscience of the agent himself should step into the vacant judgment seat, and protect those interests of others which have no external protection; judging himself all the more rigidly, because the case does not admit of his being made accountable to the judgment of his fellow-creatures.

But there is a sphere of action in which society, as distinguished from the individual, has, if any, only an indirect interest; comprehending all that portion of a person's life and conduct which affects only himself, or if it also affects others, only with their free, voluntary, and undeceived consent and participation. When I say only himself, I mean directly, and in the first instance: for whatever affects himself, may affect others through himself; and the objection which may be grounded on this nd to perform certain acts of individual beneficence, such as saving a fellow-creature's life, or interposing to protect the defenceless against ill-usage, things which whenever it is obviously a man's duty to do, he may rightfully be made responsible to society for not doing.

When I say only himself, I mean directly, and in the first instance: for whatever affects himself, may affect others through himself; and the objection which may be grounded on this contingency, will receive consideration in the sequel. This, then, is the appropriate region of human liberty. It comprises, first, the inward domain of consciousness; demanding liberty of conscience, in the most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects, practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or theological. The liberty of expressing and publishing opinions may seem to fall under a different principle, since it belongs to that part of the conduct of an individual which concerns other people; but, being almost of as much importance as the liberty of thought itself, and resting in great part on the same reasons, is practically inseparable from it. Secondly, the principle requires liberty of tastes and pursuits; of framing the plan of our life to suit our own character; of doing as we like, subject to such consequences as may follow: without impediment from our fellow-creatures, so long as what we do does not harm them, even though they should think our conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong. Thirdly, from this liberty of each individual, follows the liberty, within the same limits, of combination among individuals; freedom to unite, for any purpose not involving harm to others: the persons combining being supposed to be of full age, and not forced or deceived.

No society in which these liberties are not, on the whole, respected, is free, whatever may be its form of government; and none is completely free in which they do not exist absolute and unqualified. The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest.

Though this doctrine is anything but new, and, to some persons, may have the air of a truism, there is no doctrine which stands more directly opposed to the general tendency of existing opinion and practice. Society has expended fully as much effort in the attempt (according to its lights) to compel people to conform to its notions of personal, as of social excellence. The ancient commonwealths thought themselves entitled to practise, and the ancient philosophers countenanced, the  first, the inward domain of consciousness; demanding liberty of conscience, in the most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects, practical or speculative, scientific, moral, or theological. The liberty of expressing and publishing opinions may seem to fall under a different principle, since it belongs to that part of the conduct of an individual which concerns other people; but, being almost of as much importance as the liberty of thought itself, and resting in great part on the same reasons, is practically inseparable from it.

Society has expended fully as much effort in the attempt (according to its lights) to compel people to conform to its notions of personal, as of social excellence. The ancient commonwealths thought themselves entitled to practise, and the ancient philosophers countenanced, the regulation of every part of private conduct by public authority, on the ground that the State had a deep interest in the whole bodily and mental discipline of every one of its citizens; a mode of thinking which may have been admissible in small republics surrounded by powerful enemies, in constant peril of being subverted by foreign attack or internal commotion, and to which even a short interval of relaxed energy and self-command might so easily be fatal, that they could not afford to wait for the salutary permanent effects of freedom. In the modern world, the greater size of political communities, and above all, the separation between spiritual and temporal authority (which placed the direction of men's consciences in other hands than those which controlled their worldly affairs), prevented so great an interference by law in the details of private life; but the engines of moral repression have been wielded more strenuously against divergence from the reigning opinion in self-regarding, than even in social matters; religion, the most powerful of the elements which have entered into the formation of moral feeling, having almost always been governed either by the ambition of a hierarchy, seeking control over every department of human conduct, or by the spirit of Puritanism. And some of those modern reformers who have placed themselves in strongest opposition to the religions of the past, have been noway behind either churches or sects in their assertion of the right of spiritual domination: M. Comte, in particular, whose social system, as unfolded in his Traité de Politique Positive, aims at establishing (though by moral more than by legal appliances) a despotism of society over the individual, surpassing anything contemplated in the political ideal of the most rigid disciplinarian among the ancient philosophers.

Apart from the peculiar tenets of individual thinkers, there is also in the world at large an increasing inclination to stretch unduly the powers of society over the individual, both by the force of opinion and even by that of legislation: and as the tendency of all the changes taking place in the world is to strengthen society, and diminish the power of the individual, this encroachment is not one of the evils which tend spontaneously to disappear, but, on the contrary, to grow more and more formidable. The disposition of mankind, whether as rulers or as fellow-citizens to impose their own opinions and inclinations as a rule of conduct on others, is so energetically supported by some of the best and by some of the worst  bodily and mental discipline of every one of its citizens; a mode of thinking which may have been admissible in small republics surrounded by powerful enemies, in constant peril of being subverted by foreign attack or internal commotion, and to which even a short interval of relaxed energy and self-command might so easily be fatal, that they could not afford to wait for the salutary permanent effects of freedom.

The disposition of mankind, whether as rulers or as fellow-citizens to impose their own opinions and inclinations as a rule of conduct on others, is so energetically supported by some of the best and by some of the worst feelings incident to human nature, that it is hardly ever kept under restraint by anything but want of power; and as the power is not declining, but growing, unless a strong barrier of moral conviction can be raised against the mischief, we must expect, in the present circumstances of the world, to see it increase.

It will be convenient for the argument, if, instead of at once entering upon the general thesis, we confine ourselves in the first instance to a single branch of it, on which the principle here stated is, if not fully, yet to a certain point, recognised by the current opinions. This one branch is the Liberty of Thought: from which it is impossible to separate the cognate liberty of speaking and of writing. Although these liberties, to some considerable amount, form part of the political morality of all countries which profess religious toleration and free institutions, the grounds, both philosophical and practical, on which they rest, are perhaps not so familiar to the general mind, nor so thoroughly appreciated by many even of the leaders of opinion, as might have been expected. Those grounds, when rightly understood, are of much wider application than to only one division of the subject, and a thorough consideration of this part of the question will be found the best introduction to the remainder. Those to whom nothing which I am about to say will be new, may therefore, I hope, excuse me, if on a subject which for now three centuries has been so often discussed, I venture on one discussion more.",
